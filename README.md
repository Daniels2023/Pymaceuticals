# Pymaceuticals is a data visualization project that was developed using Pandas, Scipy, and Matplotlib. The aim of this project was to analyze and visualize the results of drug testing on mice.

# "The above image show a boxplot variation between tumor volume and 4 differents drug medications"

## This project was developed as part of the UWA Data Analytics Bootcamp course.
I have worked in collaboration with Anuja Yadwadkar to get the code results listed here.

# Our first challenge was to remove duplicates from the dataset, which we achieved using Pandas' duplicate() and isin() functions. We then created summary statistic tables, which included mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and standard error of the mean.
# We visualize the data using two differents plot options:
- Pandas with DataFrame.plot()
- Matplotlib with plt.plot()

In the final section of the project, we used Scipy and intermediate statistic concepts to create a box plot and scatter plot with a linear regression line. We created a loop to calculate the quartiles and identify any possible outliers. The box plot shows the variation in tumor volume for mice treated with four different drugs, while the scatter plot visualizes the correlation between tumor volume and mouse weight, along with a linear regression line.

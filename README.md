Pymaceuticals is a data visualization project based on Pandas, Scipy and Matplotlib.

"The above image show a boxplot between tumor volume and 4 differents drug medications tested in mice"

This project was developed as a UWA data analytics assessments through the Data Analytics bootcamp course.
I have worked in partneship with Anuja Yadwadkar to get the code results listed here.

Firstly, this project challenges you to remove duplicates from the data set. It was used duplicate() and isin() to find and remove duplicates.
Then create a summary statistic tables with mean, median, var, std and sem.
Followed by bar and pie charts using two differents plot options:
- Pandas with DataFrame.plot()
- Matplotlib with plt.plot()

"The image shows one of the barchart created using Matplotlib."

In the last section a boxplot, scatter and correlation plots was created using scipy and intermediate statistic concept.
It was created a loop with quartiles calculations and printing possibles outliers.
Then a boxplot showing the variation of tumor volumes and 4 different drug medications followed by scatter plot with the correlation and a linear regression of tumor volume and mouse weight.
